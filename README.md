For security reasons, Thunderbird does not allow users to open attached Windows shortcuts directly. This add-on allows attached shortcut files to be opened directly by a double click.

NOTICE: This can grow security risks, because this bypasses security checks for attached files. BE CAREFULLY WHEN YOU USE THIS ADDON.
